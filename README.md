Explain the concept of inheritance and how the super keyword is used in Objective-C

Inheritance allows a class to be defined that has a certain set of characteristics such as methods and instance 
variables and other classes to be created which are derived from that class.  The derived class then inherits 
all of the features from the parent class then typically adds some features of its own.  When we derive classes 
we make a class heirarchy, the classes at the top of the heirarche is called the root or base class (parent) and 
the derived classes are subclasses (children).  CLasses dont only have to be derived from parent classes they can 
also be derived from other subclasses to later make larger and more complex classes.   

The super keyword is used in objective C is used as self is used to refer to the superclass implementation of methods and instance methods.  It is used in syntax to be used to relay back to the baseclass.
